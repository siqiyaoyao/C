Task Description

Given a convex quadrilateral Q, please determine if the origin (0,0) is with Q. For example, if Q has four corners (2,1), (−1,2), (−2,−1), and (−1,−3) then the answer is yes. If Q is (12,1), (9,2), (8,−1), and (9,−3) then the answer is no.

Input

The input consists of eight integers, a,b,c,d,e,f,g, and h, representing the four corners (a,b),(c,d),(e,f), and (g,h) in counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that the four sides of the Q will not be parallel to either x or y axis, and will not contain the origin. The absolute value of all numbers is no more than 100.

Output

The output is either 1 or 0, representing that the origin is within or not within Q.
