Task Description

Write a program to print 1 if the three positive integers a, b, and c are valid lengths of a triangle, print 0 otherwise. We can verify the condition by assuring that all a, b, and c are positive, and the sum of any two of them is greater than the third.

Input Format

There are three lines in the input. The first line has the integer a, the second line has the integer b, and the third line has the integer c.

Output Format

There are one line in the output. The line has 1 if the lengths are valid, 0 otherwise.
