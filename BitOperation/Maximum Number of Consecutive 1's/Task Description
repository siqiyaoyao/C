Task Description

Write a program to compute the maximum number of consecutive 1's in their binary representation. For example 7 has three consecutive 1's since its binary representation is 00000111. 25 has two because its binary representation is 00011001.

Input

A set of positive integers no more than 2147483647, one per line. You must process them until EOF.

Output

The maximum number of consecutive 1's in the input, one per line.
