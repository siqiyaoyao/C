Task Description

Write a program to compute the number of 1's in their binary representation. For example 7 has three 1's since its binary representation is 00000111. 25 also has three ones because its binary representation is 00011001.

Input

A set of positive integers no more than 9223372036854775807, one per line. You must process them until EOF.

Output

The number of 1's in the binary representation of the input integer, one per line.
